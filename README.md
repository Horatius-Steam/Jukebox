A MP3 Player with an old dialer from 1950

I used a PICAXE for that projekt, so the code ist in BASIC with German comments.
Controlled is everythin by an old rotary dialer.
The dialer reslut is shown with nixie tubes.
To protect the whole audio circuite the audio will be switched off during the dialing process.
